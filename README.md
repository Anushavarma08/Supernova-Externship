# Supernova MGU Externship Project

## Overview
During my externship at Supernova MGU in collaboration with TripleTen, I conducted an in-depth analysis of health inspection data, focusing on infractions and the severity of actions taken by health units. This project aimed to uncover trends, correlations, and actionable insights to improve decision-making and risk management strategies.

## Business Question
**Is there a relationship between total infractions and the severity of actions taken by the health unit?**

## Objective
- Determine whether there is a positive, negative, or no correlation between the number of infractions and the severity of actions taken.
- Analyze trends and patterns to explore if an increase in infractions consistently results in more severe actions.

## Data Variables
- **Severity Rank**: Numeric representation of action severity (1 = No actions required, 21 = Closure or Suspension).
- **Total Infraction Count**: Average number of infractions associated with each action category.

## Key Insights
1. **Total Infraction and Severity**
   - Higher severity ranks generally corresponded to higher average infraction counts.
   - Food facilities exhibited the highest average infraction counts (4.6) compared to other facility types.

2. **Trends Over Facility Types**
   - Most facility types showed a positive correlation between severity rank and infraction count.

3. **Trends Over Regions**
   - The **Wellington Health Unit** displayed a unique pattern, with higher severity ranks (19-21) dominating the infractions analysis.
   - Escalation in infraction counts at higher severity levels indicated stricter inspections or more critical issues in Wellington.

4. **Trends Over Time**
   - In 2024, Wellington exhibited a significant increase in severe infractions compared to previous years, highlighting elevated food safety risks.

## Recommendations
- **Risk-Tiered Pricing Model**: Develop dynamic insurance premiums based on facility type, past infraction rates, and regional risk profiles.
- **Proactive Risk Management**: Offer premium incentives for facilities demonstrating robust compliance and preventative measures.

## Tools Used
- **Dataiku**: For data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.
- **Tableau**: For creating dashboards and visualizing insights.

## Conclusion
The analysis revealed a positive correlation between infraction counts and the severity of actions taken. Regional anomalies like Wellington emphasized the need for targeted risk management strategies. The insights provided actionable recommendations for improving insurance pricing models and facility compliance incentives.
